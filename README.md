# Rock Paper Scissors game

Rock paper scissors is a really simple game to play. All you need to play it is your hands and a second player but what if you don't have a second player and you would like to play rock paper scissors? You can play on my website with a computer. My website aims at nearly all ages. Rock paper scissors game is very simple to play and nearly all ages can play it.

## Features 

There are a few features on my website like a feedback box or a footer which simply tells you to have fun. All the existing features will be listed down below.

- __on:Hover feature__

  - This feature makes the Rock üëä Paper ‚úã or Scissors ‚úåÔ∏è bigger when you hover your mouse over it.

- __Results__

  - The results look really simple, if you win you can see youre sign with full color and when you lose your sign has less color so it is easier to see who win, you or the computer. 
  - There can be a winner, a loser and a draw. If there is a draw both of the signs are a bit without color.

### Features Left to Implement

- Register page.
- More games.

## Testing 

My website has passed HTML and CSS Validator testing with no issues. 

My website works on different screen sizes like for e.g. phone screen. 

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

I have deployed my website on github pages. [Github pages](https://github.com/)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, go to the Settings tab.
