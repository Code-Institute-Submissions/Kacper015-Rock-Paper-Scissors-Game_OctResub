## Features 

There are a few features on my website like a feedback box or a footer which simply tells you to have fun. All the existing features will be listed down below. 

### Existing Features

- __Random generator__
  
  -There is a random generator imported to the project. This makes the game interesting as the ship is always in a different position
 
- __Results__

  - The ships are showed on the grid as a O. If you hit it it marks the spot as X.
  - If you hit all the O in less then 50 bullets you win the game.

## Testing 

My website has passed HTML and CSS Validator testing with no issues. 

My website works on different screen sizes like for e.g. phone screen. 

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

I have deployed my website on github pages. [Github pages](https://github.com/)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, go to the Settings tab.
  - In the settings tab find github pages.
  - When your website is public, you can host your website through github pages.
